### USAGE GUIDELINES
# How to apply this pattern language

1. Start with architectural patterns (1-3) to establish system foundation
2. Apply subsystem patterns (4-6) to organize major components
3. Implement construction patterns (7-9) for specific functionality
4. Follow dependency relationships - implement prerequisites first
5. Validate pattern integration through testing and observation
6. Allow patterns to evolve and adapt based on system needs

### QUALITY MEASURES
# Alexander's quality criteria adapted for software

WHOLENESS: Each pattern contributes to overall system coherence
ALIVENESS: Patterns enable dynamic, adaptive behavior
BALANCE: Forces are resolved, not just managed
COHERENCE: Patterns work together harmoniously
SIMPLICITY: Essential complexity only, no accidental complexity
NATURALNESS: Patterns feel organic and inevitable in context
